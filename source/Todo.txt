TODO

Priority: get enemy to shoot at player and only when whithin a certain range

1. Random Map Generation
 - make enemy positions in ogmo POTENTIAL positsions, then depending on where the player comes in from, dont spawn the close enemies
 - add parts to rooms (
 - add attributes to rooms (
 - create map object that consists of rooms
	- rooms must connect correctly (no doors leading nowhere)
	- it must choose from a list of rooms based on their attributes
 - randomly genreate rooms when a new map is created

2. Pathfinding

3. generate random dungeon and floor name, maybe random player names

4. replace art

5. 
GENERATE MAP- REWARD after all enemies dead, destructable tile, not all rooms need 4 doors, enemies that just wander, enemy bullets, put in right part of room
have some enemy tiles be certain enemy, other tiles can be random enemy (so certain maps have a certain enemy configuration), room remember if beaten
set a variable in the room to flag you have beaten, and when that flag is set you can also spawn reward for just beating room
PATHFINDING- override FlxBaseTileMap.findmap to include entities from omgoloader not just walls, and then how to use what it returns (how to use paths)

BUGS
1. random bullet angle bug
2. enemgy teleport to you when hit bug
